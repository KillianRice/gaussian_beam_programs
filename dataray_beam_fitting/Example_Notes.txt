% Below is an example of a notes files that is useful for maintaining good records of profile changes. When you begin a project, start by measuring all the relevant distances and each time you make a change, note it in this file.

Arm B - First Pass
--------------------------------
%3.5  - Mirror 5 to dichroic
%14   - Mirror 4 to Mirror 5
%23.5 - Mirror 3 to Mirror 4
%46   - Mirror 2 to Mirror 3
%25   - Mirror 1 to Mirror 2

%Distances for this profile
%14.6 - Flange edge to Atoms
%21.5 - Dichroic to Flange Edge
%36.1 - Dichroic to atoms 
%8.3  - Dichroic to f=250mm cylindrical lens center
%16.4 - Dichroic to temporary turning mirror
%11.1 - Temporary turning mirror to track zero
%-3.5 - Rear of cart to detector

The location of the atoms is 8.6cm along the track. This means that I want the rear of the cart at 12.1cm to put the detector at the location of the atoms.

Right now I see the waist at 13.8cm. 

The lens is 3.4mm thick.

Possible reasons for the discrepancy/Sources of uncertainty
* Measurement accuracy by hand
* Diagonal beam propagation (vs straight)
* Viewport acting as lens
* Knowledge of viewport thickness (at most adding about 2mm of optical length)
