This program helps you to quickly take profiles and perform beam fitting using the Dataray camera. 

Instructions
1. After setting up to take your profile, fill in the notes file and determine whatever your translation distance to set zero needs to be and set the `translate_dist` variable in `runProfile.m`. This variable allows you to translate your track measurements to a meaningful zero. A common use case for this is when taknig data you record the track measurement but when plotting you want a meaningful zero (at the atoms, referencing some optic, etc.) to interpret your result, translate_dist lets you transform from track values to something useful.
2. To take data simply setup the logging feature of the dataray software and save into the /dataray directory in this folder. ##NOTE## The dataray data file must be saved using the form '<xx>.log' where <xx> is assumed (by subsequent functions) to be in centimeters. <xx> should be a number such as '16.7' or '2.356', the program simply take whatever is before `.log` and assumes it is a number in cm.
3. Assuming you saved the data correctly, filled in the wavelength of the laser, and set your translation distance, you can run `runProfile.m` to rad in the data and automatically fit it using BeamProfileFits_v4_Weighted (weights are determined as the standard deviation from each track data point).
